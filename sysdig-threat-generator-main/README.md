# Sysdig Threat Generator

This repo hosts combinations of tools, both public and private, for generating test scenarios.

# Getting Started

You can build your own Docker image with the files provided in `docker/`, with the following command:
`cd docker && docker build -t sysdig-threat-generator`.  

Or, you can simply create a Kubernetes pod using a pre-built image from the YAML in `kubernetes/`.  

Supporting scripts and other tools are located in `scripts/`.

## Example Syntax

### Docker
To run some container tests in local Docker:
`docker run -it --rm sysdig-threat-generator:latest /bin/bash -c "pwsh RunTests.ps1 BASE64.SHELLSCRIPT <NAME.OF.OTHER.TEST> <TEST3> <...>"`

### Kubernetes
To run the same, but in K8s:
change line 20 of `Sysdig-Threat_Generator.yaml` from 

```yaml
command: ["pwsh", "-c", "(./RunTests.ps1 XMRIG.EXEC)"]
```

to

```yaml
command: ["pwsh", "-c", "(./RunTests.ps1 BASE64.SHELLSCRIPT <NAME.OF.OTHER.TEST> <...>)"]
```

### Fargate
A minimal set of terraform files that are compatible with STG and Fargate can be found at [minimal-fargate-stg](https://github.com/sysdig/minimal_fargate_stg). The only variables you *should* need to change are in [`variables.tf`](https://github.com/sysdig/minimal_fargate_stg/blob/master/variables.tf). Note that for the VPC Subnets, one must be public and the other private. Edit [`workload.tf`](https://github.com/sysdig/minimal_fargate_stg/blob/master/workload.tf#L12) with your desired tests, similarly to how we did in the K8s yaml file.
Please raise any issues/concerns in #sds-f-fargate in Slack.

# Example Tests, with Descriptions, and associated Rules
A brief description of some tests and the related alert/purpose:
| Test  | Description   |Sysdig Rule  | Caveat |
|---|---|---|---|
|  XMRIG.EXEC |Malware injected into container, cryptominer, new files/drift detection   | Cryptominer Pool, Cryptominer ML, new malicious binary  |
| STDIN.NETWORK  | Network anomaly, rev shell   | Reverse Shell to network socket  |   |   |
| DEV.SHM.EXEC  |In-mem malware    | Execution from /dev/shm  |   |   |

| CREDS.DUMP.MEMORY | Dumps system memory via Lazagne, looking for credentials |Dump Memory for Credentials | Needs --privileged|
|KILL.MALICIOUS.PROC | Kills a known malicious process, simulating an adversary taking down other cryptominers on a target system. | Kill Malicious Process
|MEMFD.EXEC| Writes and then executes an ELF File to/from a `memfd`, an in-memory file descriptor (medium to advanced malware technique). | TBC (needs agent support)
|SUBTERFUGE.CURL.SOCKS| Uses a SOCKS proxy to get on the Tor network. |TBD

|Base64.SHELLSCRIPT| Uses the base64 utility to decode and write a shell script| Base64 Shell Script
|CONNECT.UNEXPECTED| Creates a connection from an "unexpected" process, as if someone had pwned a server and hijacked control to their c2 server| 
Runtime threat/threat actor behavior - LD.LINUX.EXEC, LOAD.BPF.PROG, RECON.FIND.SUID, BASE64.CLI
